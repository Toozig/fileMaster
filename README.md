# File Documentation Script

This script helps to document files in the system. It takes as input a path to a file and creates a JSON file in the same folder with the file documentation.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Toozig/fileMaster
    ```

2. Navigate to the repository directory:
    ```bash
    cd your_repo
    ```

3. Run the script with the path to the file you want to document. For example:
    ```bash
    ./script.sh /path/to/your/file.txt
    ```

## Requirements

- Docker

## Notes

- Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system before running the script.
- Replace `/path/to/your/file.txt` with the actual path to the file you want to document.
- After running the script, a JSON file containing the documentation will be created in the same directory as the input file.
